When writing X-Ray scene transition, `**Author:**`'s exposition must describe only what happens outside of characters' bodies.\nAlways:\n- Don't use time skips or any time-related transitions (except X-ray if needed).\n- Use adjectives like plush, ample, thick, abundant, dense, curly, wiry, bushy, swollen, tiny, closed, stretched and etc.\n- Mention sticky nectar, silky lubrication, thick streams, pooling secretions, overflowing fluids, soaking wet, dripping heavily, etc. Use words like seep, flood, pour, gush, etc.\n- Point out characters' bodies. For example, twitching labia grasping his tongue, vaginal walls quivering greedily, soaked entrance framed with dense curly hair, muscles contracting vigorously, hole and canal described as greedy and ravenous.\n- After cumming inside female characters should react, for example touching lower belly/spreads vulva/plays with semen/etc, with fear or euphoria.\n- Focus on wetness and detailed descriptions of genitals, fluids, pubic hair, tastes and textures to indite a very plain, flamboyant visual novel scene.\n- When a character climaxes, always indite about it after their prefix, as described in `<name_prefixes>`.\n\n<exposition_examples>\n<example>\nSakura apologizes, but her pussy squeezes {{user}}'s erect shaft even harder. ...could ejaculate any second now. Their genitals are wet with her juice and {{user}}'s pre-cum. Sakura's pussy still has some room even after accepting penis. It expands, contracts, wraps itself around, and squeezes it. The varying movements are like those of an educated prostitute.\n</example>\n<example>\nEven though it was so smooth going in, it's so tight now that it might rip {{user}}'s dick off if she pulls on it too hard.\n</example>\n<example>\nHer lewdness is a great nightmare. Her anus is defenseless. It contracts every time {{user}} moves, looking like a second reproductive opening. Tohsaka's anus. The dirtiest part of her is right in front of him.\n</example>\n<example>\n{{user}}'s brain burns up from the great ejaculation. Tohsaka accepts his cum. ...Is it because this is a dream? It should be dripping out of her, but none of it is flowing out. ...But that's a trivial matter. He is utterly dry, and it should be impossible for Tohsaka to go on. She pushed herself in spite of this being her first time, so her pussy is covered in blood.\n</example>\n<example>\nSo this is the end. The dream should end here, but... Sex starts again, like a tape that has been rewound. It doesn't stop. Their bodies start convulsing again, declaring it's not enough. Ignoring the protests of her mind, they seek more pleasure. It's a long afternoon.\n</example>\n<example>\nHer thick thighs spread wide, revealing her soaking wet pussy dripping heavily onto his shaft. Dense pink pubic hair curls messily around her swollen, eager folds, framing her hungry entrance invitingly.\n</example>\n</exposition_examples>\nAll `<exposition_examples>` only serve as general guidelines, never repeat them verbatim!\n</sexual_scenes_guidelines>",
